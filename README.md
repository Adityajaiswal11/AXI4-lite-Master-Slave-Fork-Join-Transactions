# AXI4-Lite Master-Slave Communication with Fork-Join Transactions in SystemVerilog
==================================================================================

üìå Overview
-----------
This project implements and verifies an AXI4-Lite protocol-based communication system between a master and a slave module using SystemVerilog. The design simulates multiple read and write transactions executed in parallel using the fork-join construct in the testbench.

The simulation is performed in Vivado Simulator (XSim), with output logs printed to the TCL console and signal transitions visualized via the waveform viewer.

üéØ Aim
------
To design and verify an AXI4-Lite master-slave communication system using SystemVerilog, perform concurrent read and write transactions using the fork-join construct in the testbench, and validate functional correctness via simulation output and waveform analysis.

üß† Key Concepts
---------------
- AXI4-Lite Protocol: A lightweight version of the AXI protocol for memory-mapped read/write.
- Master-Slave Design: Master initiates read/write; slave responds accordingly.
- Fork-Join: SystemVerilog construct to allow parallel execution of tasks in simulation.
- Vivado XSim: Simulation tool used for verifying design behavior and waveforms.

üî¨ Testbench Features
---------------------
- Executes multiple read and write transactions concurrently using fork-join.
- Distinct data and address for each transaction.
- $display output for each transaction is printed to the TCL console.
- Generates VCD waveform for visual analysis.
- Final message indicates all transactions are completed.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
-------------
1. Open Vivado (2023.2 or later).
2. Create a project and add all `.sv` files to simulation sources.
3. Set `tb_axi4_lite.sv` as the simulation top module.
4. Run behavioral simulation.
5. View:
   - TCL console logs for transaction flow
   - Waveform viewer for signal activity (via axi4_lite.vcd)
